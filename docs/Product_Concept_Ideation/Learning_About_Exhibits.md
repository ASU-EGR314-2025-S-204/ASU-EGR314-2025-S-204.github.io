## Take Away from Science Exhibit Articles

The goal of our exhibit is to demonstrate how an ultrasonic distance sensor works and how we can make changes based on different distances that the sensor reads. We choose to use an ultrasonic distance sensor for our demonstration because it is a very common sensor used in devices like room navigating robots, backup sensors on cars, drones, and more. The hope of our exhibit is that the guests will leave having learned more about an ultrasonic distance sensor then they had known before, especially if they hadnâ€™t known anything about it before. 
Our audience is applied to all ages with different amounts of knowledge about a distance sensor. We decided that the best approach to demonstrate and teach about the sensor was to create a device that can engage with anyone of any knowledge or age. We hope that our device appeals to people of all ages drawing their attention in a room full of lots of other exhibits and allows them to learn in a fun way that will help them remember the information that is being taught.
