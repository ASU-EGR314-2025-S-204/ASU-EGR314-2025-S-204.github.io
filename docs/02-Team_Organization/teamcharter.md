## Team Goals


This semester, our team has established several goals to guide our efforts and drive success. Our primary goal is to develop a functional prototype of our device, which we plan to showcase to peers and professors at the Innovation Showcase in May. This prototype will embody the knowledge we have gained from this class and previous courses, as well as demonstrate our capabilities as engineers.

Our second goal is to maintain high standards for documentation throughout the semester and in future endeavors. These standards include ensuring strong professionalism, correct grammar, and thorough documentation of even minor changes or challenges encountered during the project.

Third, we aim to embrace a growth mindset by learning from the mistakes we make along the way. Mistakes are an inevitable part of any project, and we believe it is crucial to analyze them to avoid repetition and continuously improve ourselves.
Additionally, we strive to build and strengthen professional connections. This includes deepening our relationships with professors and teammates, as well as networking with industry professionals and classmates. We recognize that collaboration is vital for achieving the full potential of any project.

Finally, we aim to expand our understanding of existing products and techniques. By studying prior work, we can learn from othersâ€™ successes and challenges, leveraging this knowledge to refine our own efforts. We believe that building on established knowledge is essential for advancing any product or innovation.
