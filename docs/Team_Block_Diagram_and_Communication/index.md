## 1) Team Block Diagram

Below is our connected team block diagram. It shows each individual block diagrams and then how all four will connect together physcially. The subsystems are chained togther with Divine's upstream of Andrey's, Andrey's upstream from Jacob's, Jacob's upstream from Jake's, and Jake's upstream from Divine's.

## 2) Sequence Diagram of Team Communication

Below is our sequence diagram of team communication. It visualizes all the messages that we will send across our subsytems and how each message will interact with every subsystem and the user inputs.
