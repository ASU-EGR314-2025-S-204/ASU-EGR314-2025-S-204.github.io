## Lessons Leaned
In Team 204 we all can agree, that the experience of working on this project turned out to be both challening and particularly educative, sometimes even in ways we haven't quite expected it to be. Here we present the top 10 most important things that we learned about the process of designing an Embedded System from this project:
1) PCB - first! This project has clearly demonstrated us, that there is no stronger fundament for programm/code configuration works than a tested and operation-verified Printed Circuit Board. Yes, a team member can have his/her susbsystem flawlessly functioning within a breadboard setup, but once the time comes to transfing it into the form of a PCB, a single faulty connection or a wrong on-surface trace placement can significantly slow down, if not ruin(!) all further system integration and set-up works. On our own experience, we've discorvered that it is crucial to finish PCB design and correlated operation verification testings as early as possible throughout the project development timeline. Operation-confirmed and working PCB is easily a half of the project's success!
2) Sometimes, Datasheet is the best advisor!
