## Lessons Learned
In Team 204 we all can agree, that the experience of working on this project turned out to be both challening and particularly educative, sometimes even in ways we haven't quite expected it to be. Here we present the top 10 most important things that we learned about the process of designing an Embedded System from this project:
1) PCB - first! This project has clearly demonstrated us, that there is no stronger fundament for programm/code configuration works than a tested and operation-verified Printed Circuit Board. Yes, a team member can have his/her susbsystem flawlessly functioning within a breadboard setup, but once the time comes to transfing it into the form of a PCB, a single faulty connection or a wrong on-surface trace placement can significantly slow down, if not ruin(!) all further system integration and set-up works. On our own experience, we've discorvered that it is crucial to finish PCB design and correlated operation verification testings as early as possible throughout the project development timeline. Operation-confirmed and working PCB is easily a half of the project's success!
2) Sometimes, Datasheet is the best advisor! Many problems could have been avoided if more attention was put towards examining, exploring and interpreting datahseets in a right manner. Probably one of the most significant examples in support of this conclusion would be a 3-week delay, that happened with the process of configuring the project's sensor subsystem due to a single misinterpretation of the target sensor's I2C device adress! Making sure that you have understood and correctly interpreted the datasheet, is one of the largest, is not a central key to success in configuring your target electrical/electromechanical component
3) Knowing how to debug is almost important as knowing how to code. From the perspective of a project's end, we can definitely admit, that a lot of time could have been "saved" back at the active development period, if only we began to use the debugging tools earlier, than when we actually decided to. A conclusion like this is rational both to "internal", through-code debugging using tools like MPLAB Snap, and "external", based on oscilloscope probing and multimeter measurements. We want to particularly mention the value of Oscilloscope - considering how much our project relies on various types of serial communication, this tool simply doesn't have alternatives, that could handle the task of analyzing the communication sequences in such practical manner. Learning how to thoroughly use this tool ended up being no less than **crucial** to the configuration of some of our subsystems
4) Always plan ahead and keep in mind an approximate problem-solving strategy before starting to complete the working task, even if it seems relatively easy to complete!
5) Being able to fluently code in target programming language/framework is optional, but almost always significantly simplifies your programming experience and is capable of solving a lot of potentially-wasted time
6) PCB design is a perfect case of "better safe than sorry"! Always try to eliminate as many potential signal/power transfer issues as possible at the stage of PCB design. Sure, you can always perform countless soldering adjustments, but after you get your PCB, its internal structure is "set in stone", and you can't do nothing about it
7) Soldering must be treated with extreme care and caution! A single proper soldering session can save enormous amount of time on post-soldering testings and fixing the soldering defects
8) Constantly keeping in touch with your teammates on the topic of inter-team communications and messaging format is crucial to the project's success. It will be really sad, if on the demo day the team will find out that team member #3 cannot receive proper information from team member #1, because one month ago the first team member decided to change 
9) Proper communication and knowledge sharing always rewards! Exchanging with your peers the information known over a problem can be as helpful as searching for information online or asking for help on online forums
