## Device Description


Our interactive science exhibit is an object-following robot designed to engage and educate museum visitors through a hands-on, dynamic experience. The robot detects and follows an object in front of it, adjusting its movement in real-time to stay aligned. This functionality is achieved through a body that houses the electronic components and is powered by two motors on either side with three ultrasonic distance sensors placed at the front. These sensors are configured in a row with the two outer sensors angled outward to provide a broader field of vision. When an object is detected the sensors determine its location by which sensor sees it and the distance and the motors adjust accordingly ensuring the robot stays aligned with the central sensor. This feature is prominently showcased in our concept model and sketches which detail the placement of the sensors, actuators, and internal components, as well as the robot's behavior when interacting with objects. <br>To enhance interactivity users can adjust the robot’s following distance either through a web-based interface or directly on the device. The device is divided into four key systems: a sensor system for collecting data, an actuator system for movement, an internet-based two-way communication system for controlling distance and receiving sensor information, and a user interface that allows direct interaction via buttons and displays. To make the robot accessible to all visitors, clear visual and auditory cues will guide their interaction. A screen on the device will display instructions and buttons will be clearly labeled with icons or text to indicate their functions. For example, a distinctly colored button will initiate the object-following process and a sound might play to alert the user the process has started. This intuitive setup aligns with the principles outlined in "Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits," emphasizing simplicity and clarity. Our controls are designed for both ease and engagement. Visitors can start and stop the object-following mode, adjust the distance, or explore the web interface to see real-time sensor data and robot responses. By keeping the controls minimal yet functional we ensure that users can quickly grasp the device's capabilities without feeling overwhelmed. The design balances educational value with user-friendly functionality, encouraging visitors to explore further. <br>To make the robot both appealing and robust we are enclosing it in a 3D-printed cover shaped like a mouse. This choice enhances durability by protecting the internal components and adds an element of charm that makes the robot approachable for visitors of all ages. Safety is a top priority: the robot will automatically stop moving if no object is detected within the designated range, preventing it from wandering aimlessly or colliding with obstacles. This design ensures a safe and controlled interaction while the exterior provides a comfortable experience.To minimize confusion a brief and clearly written set of instructions will be displayed near the exhibit outlining the robot’s features and explaining how to interact with it. Visitors will also find additional information about the robot’s inner workings organized by subsystems. This explanation will follow the sequence of the robot's operation: sensing, processing, and movement, allowing users to understand the technology behind the exhibit. Visitors will leave with a greater appreciation for sensor technology, robotics, and interactive design, all while enjoying a memorable and engaging experience.
