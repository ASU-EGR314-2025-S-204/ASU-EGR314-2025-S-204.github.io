title: Ideation and Concept Generation
---

This is the entry page for the directory that includes all files that are related to the Product Concept Generation activities and processes. This section is divided into multiple parts. Starting with our [Product concepts brainstorming](ProductConceptsBrainstorming.md), where we came up with ideas for what our project will be this semester based off of course requirements and team intrests. Then we started [Learning about creating science exhibits](Articles.md), which taught us more about creating an exhibit that can excit people and how we can make our project into an exhibit. After learning how to create a proper exhibit we started to develop our project idea even further with our [Product Overview](Productoverview.md) developed our [Design Concept Sketches](DesignConceptSketch.md). From there we developed a [Presentation](PresentationVideo.md) to propose our project, talk more about what we want to accomplish, what we learned about creating exhibits and how our project follows the exhibit desing rules.
