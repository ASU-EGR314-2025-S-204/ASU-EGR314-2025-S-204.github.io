## Product Mission Statement

### Our Product Offering
Our teamwork is centered around developing the devices that can provide interaction with certain physical processes related to solid and liquid body mechanics, supporting a well-defined “control-feedback” loop. As an important part of design process, we will also ensure that our products will be easy to setup and maintain by the sole effort of the end user

### Out Core Values 
We want to contribute to facilitating physical education across middle and high schools. In this manner, the devices of our team should be able to provide interactive learning and exploration of the selected mechanical processes and phenomena. Along with this, we keen to reach smooth and intuitive user experience for our products

### Offering and values
Based on the outlined core values and product offering-s, we can highlight an opportunity for a practical synthesis between those aspects of a product mission. We believe that a device that can provide interactive observation and exploration of the selected mechanical process would serve best in the context of learning and studying that process. On the other hand, efforts on making our systems easy to “handle” should contribute to creating an enhanced user experience for our clients. Altogether, we hope that those features will ensure that our product mission is headed towards helping to develop a more advanced system of physical education for students all across the country

## Summary
Our team is dedicated to develop easy-to-maintain solutions representing different controllable processes and effects from mechanics for use by students in STEM-based classes as a supportive tool for interactive learning
