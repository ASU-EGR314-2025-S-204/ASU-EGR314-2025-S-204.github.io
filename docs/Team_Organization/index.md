This is the entry page for the directory that includes all files that are related to the team organization activities and processes. Within this section is the [Product Mission Statement](Product_Mission_Statement.md) and the [Team Charter](teamcharter.md). In the Mission Statement we layout our desired user experience and where we want the project to go and in the Team Charter we describe the goals that we hope to complete this semester and what we hope to get out of this project and the class.
