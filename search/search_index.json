Our primary goal is to develop a functional prototype of our device, which we plan to showcase to peers and professors at the Innovation Showcase in May. This prototype will embody the knowledge we have gained from this class and previous courses, as well as demonstrate our capabilities as engineers. Our second goal is to maintain high standards for documentation throughout the semester and in future endeavors. These standards include ensuring strong professionalism, correct grammar, and thorough documentation of even minor changes or challenges encountered during the project. Third, we aim to embrace a growth mindset by learning from the mistakes we make along the way. Mistakes are an inevitable part of any project, and we believe it is crucial to analyze them to avoid repetition and continuously improve ourselves. Additionally, we strive to build and strengthen professional connections. This includes deepening our relationships with professors and teammates, as well as networking with industry professionals and classmates. We recognize that collaboration is vital for achieving the full potential of any project. Finally, we aim to expand our understanding of existing products and techniques. By studying prior work, we can learn from others\u2019 successes and challenges, leveraging this knowledge to refine our own efforts. We believe that building on established knowledge is essential for advancing any product or innovation.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.</p> <p>Some of the main features of MathJax include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages</p> </li> <li> <p>Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special   setup for the reader</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other   advanced functionality</p> </li> <li> <p>Powerful API for integration with other web applications</p> </li> </ul> <p>See http://www.mathjax.org/ for additional details about MathJax, and https://docs.mathjax.org for the MathJax documentation.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax-components","title":"MathJax Components","text":"<p>MathJax version 3 uses files called components that contain the various MathJax modules that you can include in your web pages or access on a server through NodeJS.
