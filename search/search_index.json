We choose to use an ultrasonic distance sensor for our demonstration because it is a very common sensor used in devices like room navigating robots, backup sensors on cars, drones, and more. The hope of our exhibit is that the guests will leave having learned more about an ultrasonic distance sensor then they had known before, especially if they hadn\u2019t known anything about it before.  Our audience is applied to all ages with different amounts of knowledge about a distance sensor. We decided that the best approach to demonstrate and teach about the sensor was to create a device that can engage with anyone of any knowledge or age. We hope that our device appeals to people of all ages drawing their attention in a room full of lots of other exhibits and allows them to learn in a fun way that will help them remember the information that is being taught.</p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/PresentationVideo/","title":"Presentation of Ideation and Concept","text":"<p>The video below is our presentation of our team charter, mission statement, a summary of our science exhibit readings, our organized design concepts, selection process, and concept sketches and model of the concept.</p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/PresentationVideo/#presentation-video","title":"Presentation Video","text":""},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Productoverview/","title":"Product Overview","text":"<p>Created: 1/27/2025</p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Productoverview/#device-description","title":"Device Description","text":"<p>Our interactive science exhibit is an object-following robot designed to engage and educate museum visitors through a hands-on, dynamic experience. The robot detects and follows an object in front of it, adjusting its movement in real-time to stay aligned. This functionality is achieved through a body that houses the electronic components and is powered by two motors on either side with three ultrasonic distance sensors placed at the front. These sensors are configured in a row with the two outer sensors angled outward to provide a broader field of vision. When an object is detected the sensors determine its location by which sensor sees it and the distance and the motors adjust accordingly ensuring the robot stays aligned with the central sensor. This feature is prominently showcased in our concept model and sketches which detail the placement of the sensors, actuators, and internal components, as well as the robot's behavior when interacting with objects. To enhance interactivity users can adjust the robot\u2019s following distance either through a web-based interface or directly on the device. The device is divided into four key systems: a sensor system for collecting data, an actuator system for movement, an internet-based two-way communication system for controlling distance and receiving sensor information, and a user interface that allows direct interaction via buttons and displays. To make the robot accessible to all visitors, clear visual and auditory cues will guide their interaction. A screen on the device will display instructions and buttons will be clearly labeled with icons or text to indicate their functions. For example, a distinctly colored button will initiate the object-following process and a sound might play to alert the user the process has started. This intuitive setup aligns with the principles outlined in \"Suggested Guidelines for Designing Interactive Exhibits,\" emphasizing simplicity and clarity. Our controls are designed for both ease and engagement. Visitors can start and stop the object-following mode, adjust the distance, or explore the web interface to see real-time sensor data and robot responses. By keeping the controls minimal yet functional we ensure that users can quickly grasp the device's capabilities without feeling overwhelmed. The design balances educational value with user-friendly functionality, encouraging visitors to explore further. To make the robot both appealing and robust we are enclosing it in a 3D-printed cover shaped like a mouse. This choice enhances durability by protecting the internal components and adds an element of charm that makes the robot approachable for visitors of all ages. Safety is a top priority: the robot will automatically stop moving if no object is detected within the designated range, preventing it from wandering aimlessly or colliding with obstacles. This design ensures a safe and controlled interaction while the exterior provides a comfortable experience.To minimize confusion a brief and clearly written set of instructions will be displayed near the exhibit outlining the robot\u2019s features and explaining how to interact with it. Visitors will also find additional information about the robot\u2019s inner workings organized by subsystems. This explanation will follow the sequence of the robot's operation: sensing, processing, and movement, allowing users to understand the technology behind the exhibit. Visitors will leave with a greater appreciation for sensor technology, robotics, and interactive design, all while enjoying a memorable and engaging experience.</p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Product_Concept_Brainstorming/","title":"Product Concept Brainstorming","text":"<p>This is the entry page for the directory that includes all diagrams and charts that are related to the brainstorming stage of the Product Concept Ideation process</p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Product_Concept_Brainstorming/FnlSelection/","title":"Final Concept Selection","text":"<p>And here you can withness our team's final choice of the project's design concept!</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Product_Concept_Brainstorming/RawDesignConc/","title":"Raw Design Concepts","text":"<p>This page presents selection of the first \u2053100 concepts generated by the team in the initial stage of Desing Ideation brainstorming</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Concept_Ideation/Product_Concept_Brainstorming/SortRank/","title":"Sorting and Ranking the Project Concepts","text":"<p>On this page you can see the results of processing the array of concepts presented on a previous page</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Team_Organization/","title":"Team organization","text":"<p>This is the entry page for the directory that includes all files that are related to the team organization activities and processes</p>"},{"location":"Team_Organization/Product_Mission_Statement/","title":"Product Mission Statement","text":"<p>Created: 1/17/2025</p>"},{"location":"Team_Organization/Product_Mission_Statement/#product-mission-statement","title":"Product Mission Statement","text":""},{"location":"Team_Organization/Product_Mission_Statement/#our-product-offering","title":"Our Product Offering","text":"<p>Our teamwork is centered around developing the devices that can provide interaction with certain physical processes related to solid and liquid body mechanics, supporting a well-defined \u201ccontrol-feedback\u201d loop.
